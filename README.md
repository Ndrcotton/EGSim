# EGSim
 EGSim is a vapor compression system tool developed based on physics-based simulation for typical mini-split air conditioning systems comprised of a compressor, discharge line, condenser, liquid line, capillary tube, 2-phase line, evaporator, and suction line. The tool was funded under support from UNIDO through the Egyptian HPMP-II.
